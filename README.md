“The Software Engineer Enhancement Tool using Java”
AI-Powered Software Engineer Enhancement Tool Model

This AI-driven tool is designed to assist software engineers in streamlining tasks like
debugging, coding, running, and deployment through context-aware quizzes,
interactive guidance, and skill-building exercises. It integrates real-time feedback,
personalized learning, and automation to reduce errors, improve code quality, and
accelerate development workflows.

The system will use a Java-centric backend (Spring Boot) for business logic, a React
frontend, and integrations with Java-based code analysis tools.
. Backend (Spring Boot)


● REST API
Code Analysis Engine

● JavaParser: Analyze code snippets for AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) parsing.

● Integration with SonarQube: Use SonarJava for code quality checks
Database Integration

● PostgreSQL: Store quizzes, user profiles, and progress.

● Spring Data JPA: Simplify database operations.
IDE Integration (VS Code Plugin): VS Code Extension (TypeScript)
